# 11. Production readiness

Use this chapter when you are preparing a multi-agent system for its release
decision. It is a checklist of the evidence you produce and the sign-off you
need. It assumes each member has already passed the single-agent
[production readiness](../core/12-production-readiness.md) checklist
and covers only what the composed system adds.

Readiness is a decision about one exact composition manifest, made on
evidence. File presence, member readiness, a successful demo, or passing
average quality does not establish system readiness. Each item below should
point to an artifact a reviewer can check.

## Scope and decision

- [ ] System name, version, composition manifest, release, and environment are
  identified.
- [ ] Accountable product, engineering, operational, security, and risk owners
  are named.
- [ ] Intended and prohibited uses, users, affected parties, jurisdictions, and
  scale are documented.
- [ ] Execution class, governance tier, residual risk, and launch decision
  agree across artifacts.
- [ ] The multi-agent admission test and simpler baseline comparison are
  complete.
- [ ] Conditions for `go`, `conditional_go`, or `no_go` have owners and
  evidence.

## Member conformance

- [ ] Every reachable static member conforms to the single-agent guidance.
- [ ] Dynamic admission proves equivalent required conformance before
  dispatch.
- [ ] Member names, versions, manifests, owners, and risk assessments are
  pinned or recorded.
- [ ] Roles narrow rather than expand member capabilities.
- [ ] Required, optional, advisory, substitutable, and fallback members are
  classified.
- [ ] Independence claims document shared models, context, evidence,
  infrastructure, and owners.
- [ ] Quarantine and revocation status is enforced before new work.

## System contract

- [ ] The System Spec validates and has no unresolved production placeholders.
- [ ] Topology, orchestrator, coordinator, members, roles, and edges are
  explicit.
- [ ] Every interaction has typed input, output, policy, timeout, retry, and
  failure behavior.
- [ ] State ownership, conflict policy, accepted evidence, and terminal
  outcomes are defined.
- [ ] The composition manifest is reproducible and immutable for the release.
- [ ] Cross-artifact name, version, graph, class, tier, policy, and digest
  checks pass.

## Authority and data flow

- [ ] Authenticated actor, tenant, environment, and purpose originate outside
  model control.
- [ ] Authority attenuation is enforced at interaction and tool boundaries.
- [ ] No member receives undeclared credentials, tools, network access, or
  data.
- [ ] Every edge has data-classification, minimization, residency, retention,
  and deletion policy.
- [ ] Parent histories, hidden instructions, credentials, and unrelated
  evidence are not forwarded implicitly.
- [ ] Artifact references require independent authorization and integrity
  checks.
- [ ] Consequential actions require valid approval bound to the final action
  and composition.

## Dynamic architecture

Skip this section only if membership and graph are fully static.

- [ ] Dynamic behavior has a documented benefit over the best reasonable
  static design.
- [ ] Registry identity, publisher, integrity, compatibility, risk, and health
  controls are enforced.
- [ ] Every admitted member and edge appears in a reconstructable run
  manifest.
- [ ] Graph size, member count, depth, fan-out, events, rounds, time, tokens,
  and spend are bounded.
- [ ] Recursive, marketplace, blackboard, mesh, and event-loop failure cases
  are evaluated as applicable.
- [ ] No-valid-member, registry-outage, malicious-candidate, substitution, and
  revocation paths are tested.

## Durable coordination

- [ ] Long-running or state-changing execution occurs in a durable execution
  engine.
- [ ] Workflows contain deterministic coordination only.
- [ ] Agent runs, models, tools, registries, stores, and other I/O execute in
  durable steps.
- [ ] Stable workflow, durable step, member, interaction, delegation, and
  branch identities are used.
- [ ] Concurrent aggregation is deterministic and independent of incidental
  arrival order.
- [ ] Retry ownership and combined maximum execution are documented.
- [ ] Budget reservation and reconciliation survive worker loss and duplicate
  delivery.
- [ ] Cancellation propagates and compensation behavior is tested.
- [ ] Payloads and histories are bounded; large artifacts remain outside
  workflow history.
- [ ] Representative static and dynamic histories replay against the proposed
  build.

## Termination and degraded modes

- [ ] Success, degraded success, escalation, rejection, cancellation, failure,
  and partial effect are distinct.
- [ ] No-progress, policy dead-end, budget, deadline, and kill-switch
  termination are tested.
- [ ] Required work cannot be silently dropped to preserve latency or
  availability.
- [ ] Degraded modes identify missing evidence, members, checks, and
  guarantees.
- [ ] Persistent collectives bound each business task and compact durable
  history safely.

## Evaluation

- [ ] Member, interaction, coordination, end-to-end, durability, and
  adversarial suites pass.
- [ ] Every hard gate passes; no average or vote hides a violation.
- [ ] Claimed composition benefits hold against the admission baseline.
- [ ] Ablations justify material members and architectural mechanisms.
- [ ] Topology-specific cases cover routing, handoff, aggregation, conflict,
  and termination.
- [ ] Dynamic systems cover admission, graph drift, malicious candidates, and
  reproducibility.
- [ ] Stochastic paths use repeated runs and report distributions and worst
  cases.
- [ ] Recurring system failures are attributed to where they first went
  wrong and reproduced at the narrowest layer.
- [ ] Material risk scenarios map to cases, gates, indicators, alerts, and
  runbooks.
- [ ] Reports contain complete system, member, model, graph, policy, dataset,
  and build provenance.

## Observability and audit

- [ ] One trace and ledger correlate the root task through every interaction,
  agent, model, and tool.
- [ ] Async fan-out, events, queues, and handoffs propagate safe creation
  context and links.
- [ ] Initial graph and every accepted graph change are recorded.
- [ ] Required system, member, delegation, policy, budget, and outcome
  attributes are emitted.
- [ ] Metrics avoid high-cardinality or sensitive labels.
- [ ] Content capture is off by default or has approved minimization and
  retention controls.
- [ ] Consequential actions, admission, policy, overrides, and interventions
  create audit records.
- [ ] Dashboards, SLOs, and actionable alerts are owned and exercised.

## Cost and capacity

- [ ] Root and aggregate request, tool, token, time, cost, and capacity budgets
  are enforced.
- [ ] Child grants reserve from parent budgets and unused reservations
  reconcile durably.
- [ ] Worst-case graph expansion includes recursion, fan-out, events, and
  retries.
- [ ] Concurrency, queues, provider limits, backpressure, and overload
  behavior are tested.
- [ ] Mandatory review, approval, audit, and compensation capacity is
  reserved.
- [ ] Unknown model or supplier cost is not treated as zero.
- [ ] Cost per successful compliant outcome meets the release policy.

## Security and governance

These items map to [chapter 10](10-security-and-governance.md).

- [ ] The composition threat model covers every trust boundary and
  topology-specific threat.
- [ ] Prompt injection, authority laundering, confused deputy, poisoning,
  collusion, and denial-of-wallet are tested.
- [ ] Registries, packages, images, skills, tools, policies, and schemas have
  supply-chain controls.
- [ ] Member work is isolated from the policy and orchestration control plane.
- [ ] Shared state distinguishes proposed, verified, accepted, rejected, and
  superseded facts.
- [ ] Kill switches can disable runs, admission, members, edges, tools,
  effects, and active work.
- [ ] Quarantine covers active work, state contributions, approvals, caches,
  and artifacts.
- [ ] Exceptions and residual-risk acceptance are explicit, approved,
  monitored, and unexpired.

## Operations

- [ ] Runbooks cover member, registry, workflow, queue, provider, model, tool,
  store, and audit failures.
- [ ] On-call operators can inspect graph, state, budgets, approvals, and
  active descendants.
- [ ] Operators can safely pause, cancel, quarantine, substitute, compensate,
  and roll back.
- [ ] Backup, restore, retention, deletion, and evidence-preservation
  procedures are tested.
- [ ] Deployment uses staged rollout and rollback to a known composition
  manifest.
- [ ] In-flight workflows remain compatible or migrate through a tested
  process.
- [ ] Decommissioning covers members, graphs, workflows, events, credentials,
  state, and artifacts.

## Pull-request evidence

Reviewers can only judge what you show them. A behavioral change SHOULD
include:

```text
system, member, policy, schema, and workflow versions changed
reason and affected topology or graph paths
affected execution classes, governance tiers, and risk scenarios
member, interaction, system, adversarial, and replay suites run
baseline and ablation results where architecture changed
before/after quality, safety, latency, capacity, and cost
rollout, monitoring, rollback, and in-flight workflow plan
```

## Approval record

The release decision records:

```text
system and composition manifest ID
environment and rollout scope
member and run-time admission envelope
evaluation and replay reports
system risk assessment and residual scenarios
accepted risks and exceptions
conditions, owners, deadlines, and monitoring
approvers and decision time
next review date
```

A critical residual scenario, failed hard gate, missing required owner,
invalid member, incompatible replay, or unbounded consequential path is
`no_go`.

## Common pitfalls

- **Approving the members, not the system.** Every member passed its own
  checklist, and nobody checked the edges, budgets, or graph between them.
- **Approving a moving target.** Evidence came from one manifest and the
  release shipped another.
- **Letting an average hide a gate.** A high overall score was reported while
  one hard gate failed.
