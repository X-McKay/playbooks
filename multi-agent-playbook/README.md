# Multi-Agent Systems Playbook

- **Status:** Draft
- **Version:** 0.2
- **Last updated:** 2026-10-11

This playbook is a technology-neutral standard for governed multi-agent
systems: systems in which multiple AI agents coordinate to produce one governed
outcome. It describes requirements, practices, and evidence rather than any
particular SDK, framework, runtime, or vendor. It extends the
[Agent Playbook](../agent-playbook/README.md); it does not replace it.

A multi-agent system conforms only when every participating agent conforms to
the Agent Playbook and the composition conforms to this playbook. The unit of
design, evaluation, release, and operation is the versioned system composition,
not an informal collection of agents.

The playbook is intentionally opinionated. Teams may adopt stricter controls.
Exceptions should be explicit, time-bound, and approved by an accountable
owner.

## Relationship to the Agent Playbook

The Agent Playbook governs each node. This playbook governs the graph.

| Concern | Governing standard |
| --- | --- |
| Agent identity, instructions, model policy, and typed output | Agent Playbook |
| Skills, tools, authorization, and tool effects | Agent Playbook |
| Individual execution class, budgets, evals, telemetry, and risk | Agent Playbook |
| System purpose, membership, topology, and interaction graph | Multi-Agent Systems Playbook |
| Delegated authority, data flow, shared state, and termination | Multi-Agent Systems Playbook |
| System budgets, emergent behavior, composition risk, and release | Multi-Agent Systems Playbook |

When the standards appear to conflict, the stricter applicable requirement
governs. A system MUST NOT weaken a member agent's execution class, governance
tier, authorization, approval, data-handling, or budget controls.

## Normative language

The terms **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** indicate
requirement strength:

- **MUST / MUST NOT:** required for conformance.
- **SHOULD / SHOULD NOT:** expected unless a documented reason justifies an
  exception.
- **MAY:** optional.

## The standard in one page

Every production multi-agent system:

1. Documents why multiple agents are preferable to a simpler single-agent or
   deterministic design.
2. Has a stable name, version, owner, System Spec, composition manifest, and
   system risk assessment.
3. References versioned, independently conforming declarative agent
   specifications (Agent Specs) rather than duplicating their contracts.
4. Uses a reviewed topology with explicitly pinned or policy-admitted membership
   and interaction edges.
5. Treats every inter-agent boundary as an untrusted, typed, bounded API.
6. Allows delegation to attenuate authority but never to amplify it.
7. Places shared state, conflict resolution, approval, and termination under
   deterministic control.
8. Enforces system-wide and per-interaction limits for depth, fan-out,
   concurrency, rounds, requests, tools, time, tokens, and spend.
9. Uses a durable execution engine for long-running coordination or any path
   capable of an externally visible side effect.
10. Evaluates system outcomes, coordination, failure propagation, security,
    durability, latency, and total cost against an appropriate baseline.
11. Emits correlated telemetry for the complete delegation graph and retains
    auditable evidence for consequential actions.
12. Cannot ship until member and system hard gates pass and residual composition
    risks are accepted by accountable humans.

The standard supports both static and dynamic systems. Dynamic membership,
recursive task trees, shared blackboards, peer meshes, market allocation, and
event-driven collectives remain inside a deterministic control envelope and
carry a higher evidence burden proportional to their adaptability.

## Conformance equation

```text
multi-agent system conformance =
    conformance of every reachable member agent
  + conformance of the versioned composition
  + evidence for their integrated behavior
```

Passing member-agent checks does not establish system conformance. A composition
can introduce risks, costs, and failure modes that no member has in isolation.

## Before you start

The [Foundations](../foundations/README.md) guides cover the decisions this
standard assumes are settled: whether agents are the right answer, the problem
brief, zero-trust principles, and the operating model.

## Skills and implementations

Optional workflow skills that help teams apply this playbook are described in
[skills](../skills/README.md). The playbook itself stays technology-neutral.
