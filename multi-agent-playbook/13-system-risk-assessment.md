# 13. System risk assessment

A system risk assessment evaluates harms created or changed by composing
multiple agents. It references member-agent assessments and adds scenarios for
coordination, interaction, shared state, dynamic admission, aggregate authority,
and emergent behavior.

It complements—not replaces—member assessments or required legal, regulatory,
security, privacy, safety, and domain review.

## Required distinctions

- **Member risk** is assessed under the Agent Playbook for one agent and use.
- **Composition risk** arises from membership, edges, coordination, aggregate
  capability, shared state, or emergent behavior.
- **System execution class** describes how the composed work executes.
- **System governance tier** describes required assurance and oversight.
- **Inherent risk** is risk before risk-reducing controls.
- **Residual risk** remains after verified controls.
- **Launch decision** is `go`, `conditional_go`, or `no_go` for one composition
  manifest and rollout scope.

The system tier has the participating member tiers as a floor, but it is not
computed only by taking their maximum. Composition scenarios can establish a
higher tier than any member has in isolation.

## Assessment principles

1. Complete and approve required member assessments first.
2. Assess the actual graph and its maximum permitted dynamic envelope.
3. Identify concrete harm scenarios, not generic architectural concerns.
4. Consider normal use, misuse, adversarial behavior, dependency failure,
   concurrency, retries, operator error, and control failure.
5. Record inherent and residual risk without averaging members or scenarios.
6. Credit only implemented controls with design and effectiveness evidence.
7. Treat missing, stale, or incompatible member evidence as uncertainty, not low
   risk.
8. Keep risk acceptance with authorized humans independent of the assessed
   system.

## Scope

Document:

- Intended and prohibited uses
- Users, affected parties, environments, jurisdictions, and rollout size
- System purpose, topology, and claimed composition benefit
- Static members and the maximum dynamic admission envelope
- Roles, interactions, models, tools, skills, data, memory, and artifacts
- Registries, transports, queues, workflows, providers, and downstream systems
- Identities, privileges, approvals, shared state, and side effects
- Owners, operators, reviewers, and risk authorities
- Referenced member risk assessments and unresolved findings

Assess the maximum credible graph and authority allowed by policy, not only a
typical or demo execution.

## Risk dimensions

Use the Agent Playbook's eight dimensions without modification:

- Financial
- Operational
- Reputational
- Legal
- Security
- Privacy
- Regulatory
- Human impact and safety

System architecture is an amplifier or cause, not a separate harm dimension.
Score impact and likelihood using the organization's calibrated anchors and the
Agent Playbook matrix.

## Composition amplifiers

Evaluate these as drivers of likelihood or impact:

- Number, diversity, ownership, and trustworthiness of members
- Aggregate tools, credentials, network access, data, and transaction authority
- Topology depth, fan-out, concurrency, cycles, persistence, and reachability
- Model-selected routing and decomposition
- Dynamic admission, substitution, marketplaces, and external publishers
- Shared memory, blackboards, events, and derived data
- Information loss, distortion, and provenance across handoffs and summaries
- Error correlation, collusion, false consensus, and reviewer dependence
- Retry, duplication, race, ordering, and consistency behavior
- Detection latency, stop capability, reversibility, and maximum blast radius
- Dependency concentration in models, registries, workflows, and providers
- Affected population, task frequency, and system lifetime

## Required scenario families

Consider each family and record why it is applicable or not:

### Membership and supply chain

- Invalid, compromised, incompatible, or substituted member is admitted.
- Registry or publisher compromise changes available capabilities.
- Revoked or quarantined member continues receiving work.

### Authority and confused deputy

- A caller launders identity, approval, or authority through another member.
- A less privileged agent induces a privileged agent to act outside purpose.
- Aggregate system capability exceeds intended product authority.

### Data and shared state

- Sensitive data crosses an unauthorized edge or tenant.
- Shared memory, blackboard, event, artifact, or summary is poisoned.
- Aggregation or linkage creates a more sensitive derived dataset.
- Provenance or material dissent is lost.

### Coordination and emergent behavior

- Agents reinforce an incorrect claim into false consensus.
- Reviewers rubber-stamp, collude, or share correlated failure.
- Routing, handoff, or aggregation omits required work or evidence.
- Conflicting agents deadlock, oscillate, or terminate incorrectly.

### Durability and effects

- Retry, concurrency, or duplicate delivery repeats an effect.
- Cancellation fails to stop descendants or leaves partial effects.
- Stale graph, policy, approval, or state causes an unsafe action.
- Recovery or compensation operates on the wrong branch or tenant.

### Resource and availability

- Recursion, fan-out, voting, bidding, or event feedback exhausts spend or
  capacity.
- One coordinator, registry, provider, or queue becomes a systemic bottleneck.
- Resource contention harms other tenants or critical workloads.

### Human and governance

- Human approvers receive incomplete, misleading, or overwhelming evidence.
- Responsibility gaps between member and system owners delay intervention.
- Operators cannot reconstruct, stop, quarantine, or safely resume the system.

## Scenario method

Write each scenario in the Agent Playbook form:

> Because **[composition cause or initiating condition]**, the system could
> **[unsafe action, output, state, or omission]**, causing **[harm]** to
> **[affected party or asset]**.

Each scenario records:

- Stable ID, title, owner, status, and scenario family
- Primary and secondary risk dimensions
- Affected parties and assets
- Causes, preconditions, participating roles, edges, and state
- Referenced member scenarios
- Inherent impact, likelihood, tier, confidence, and rationale
- Preventive, detective, and recovery controls
- Evidence for each credited control
- Residual impact, likelihood, tier, confidence, and rationale
- Eval cases, indicators, alerts, runbooks, treatment, and acceptance

Use the scenario ID as an eval tag, trace attribute, ledger reference, alert and
runbook key, incident reference, and reassessment trigger.

## Regulatory and prohibited-use screen

Run one system-level screen in addition to member screens. Composition can
change regulatory applicability by changing purpose, affected population,
decision authority, data linkage, autonomy, or scale.

- A prohibited use is `no_go` regardless of member assessments or matrix score.
- Binding classifications set minimum system tier and controls.
- Unknown applicability is unresolved risk.
- Dynamic membership MUST NOT route around jurisdiction, residency, sector, or
  provider restrictions.
- The assessment MUST NOT claim that its score establishes legal compliance.

## Inherent-risk boundary

Assess inherent composition risk with the risk-reducing system controls absent,
while treating the basic existence and capabilities of members and topology as
part of the system under assessment.

For example, typed authorization, bounded fan-out, deterministic admission, and
human approval are controls. The fact that the system can select specialists,
aggregate their data, or reach a consequential executor is inherent capability.

## Controls and evidence

Composition controls include:

- **Preventive:** static allowlists, deterministic admission, authority
  attenuation, typed edges, isolation, data-flow policy, bounded graphs, bound
  approval, and immutable manifests.
- **Detective:** graph and interaction telemetry, admission audit, anomaly
  detection, reconciliation, drift monitoring, and independent review.
- **Recovery:** cancellation propagation, member quarantine, edge disablement,
  rollback, compensation, credential revocation, and deterministic fallback.

Evidence may include code and policy review, schema checks, deterministic tests,
system evals, adversarial exercises, failure injection, durable replay,
concurrency and duplicate tests, audit samples, production metrics, kill-switch
exercises, and independent domain review.

A member control receives composition-risk credit only when evidence shows it
remains effective through the system path. A planned, inherited-but-untested, or
self-attested control receives no residual-risk reduction.

## Governance tier and mandatory floors

The system governance tier is the highest of:

1. Maximum inherent composition-scenario tier
2. Maximum governance tier of reachable members in their assigned use
3. Legal, regulatory, contractual, or internal-policy floors
4. Aggregate-capability and topology floors

At minimum:

- Any reachable consequential action requires `human_governed` execution and at
  least the applicable Agent Playbook floor.
- Broad cross-tenant, privileged code, critical-system, or aggregate transaction
  authority is at least `high`.
- Dynamic admission of externally controlled members with material authority or
  sensitive data is at least `high` unless a documented organizational standard
  establishes a stricter floor.
- Material, potentially irreversible human or safety impact is at least `high`
  and may be `critical`.
- Unbounded recursion, fan-out, membership, events, spend, or side effects is
  `no_go`, not a risk to accept.
- Missing required member assessments, ownership, or composition evidence
  prevents a `low` classification.

## Residual-risk decision

Apply the Agent Playbook's treatment and acceptance rules. Additionally:

- A critical residual composition scenario is `no_go`.
- A high residual scenario requires independent review, designated risk-authority
  acceptance, continuous monitoring, and a tested system-level containment
  mechanism.
- Conditions attach to the exact composition manifest and rollout envelope.
- Changing members, topology, authority, scale, or dynamic-admission policy may
  invalidate acceptance.

No member, coordinator, reviewer, quorum, system-generated report, or model may
accept system risk.

## Risk-to-evidence traceability

| Risk property | Required system evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Membership and supply chain | Admission denial, integrity, revocation, substitution, and quarantine tests |
| Authority and data flow | Scope attenuation, confused-deputy, tenant, purpose, and edge-denial tests |
| Coordination | Routing, handoff, aggregation, conflict, dissent, and termination evals |
| Dynamic behavior | Graph bounds, malicious candidates, registry failure, recursion, and drift evidence |
| Durability and effects | Retry, replay, duplication, ordering, cancellation, approval, and compensation tests |
| Resource control | Expansion analysis, budget escrow, backpressure, overload, and kill-switch tests |
| Operations | Indicators, alerts, ledger, runbooks, exercises, owners, and recovery evidence |

A release fails when a material scenario lacks evidence required by its tier or
when a claimed control is contradicted by integrated-system results.

## Lifecycle and reassessment

Reassess after:

- A member, role, edge, topology, registry, model, provider, tool, skill, data
  source, memory, event, or downstream consumer changes
- Autonomy, depth, fan-out, concurrency, authority, population, frequency,
  transaction value, jurisdiction, or deployment scope increases
- Admission, routing, aggregation, retry, approval, termination, or quarantine
  policy changes
- A failed hard gate, incident, near miss, complaint, drift alert, or regulatory
  change
- Evidence shows a member or composition control is ineffective

Review intervals MUST be no longer than the strictest interval required by the
system tier, any reachable member tier, and applicable obligation.

## Canonical artifact

Store one versioned system assessment under:

```text
docs/risk-assessments/systems/<system-name>.yaml
```

Use the [system risk-assessment template](templates/system-risk-assessment.yaml).
The System Spec references it, and composition manifests, eval reports,
approvals, deployments, traces, and incidents record its version or digest.

The assessment is complete only when scope, member references, scenarios,
controls, evidence, classification, acceptance, and review dates are populated
and approved by the required humans.
